# ToMeToMeter

The Rotten "ToMeToMeter": downloads a user's ratings from Flixster and ranks movies by mow much that user likes them relative to how much everyone else likes them, then makes a pretty Web page about it:

There is no UI; meant to be run from Visual Studio.  It should run out of the box; you just need to change "USER_ID" to your numeric Flixster user ID.  If you log in and go to your profile, you'll see a URL that looks like:

[https://www.flixster.com/user/912123977/](https://www.flixster.com/user/912123977/)

The numeric string is your user ID.
